### Steps to run the Notebook:

1-Upload notebook to "Colab Notebooks" folder of your Google Drive.

2-Open the notebook in Colab, follow the steps written on the top of the notebook.

*Note:* In the "others" folder you can find the code I used to occlude images. You don't need it since I provided the pickle files in the cloud.
